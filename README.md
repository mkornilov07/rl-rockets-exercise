# Rocket Launching with RL

This is a reinforcement learning competition presented by ML@UVA, created by Mikhail, Vyas, and Shubs. Previously hosted on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-uva-reinforcement-learning-competition 

## Details
You are controlling the fuel consumption of a rocket to reach as high of an altitude as possible.

## Usage
Edit `rocket.py` to define your strategy. Run `python run.py [number of rounds] [--no-log]` to test. After running the test at least once, you can run `python view.py` to visualize the results of your latest run.

## Setup
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
